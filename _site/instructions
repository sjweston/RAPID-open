INSTRUCTIONS FOR UPDATING THE RAPID-OPEN WEBSITE.

1. Open GitHub Desktop. Click "Fetch Origin" to ensure you have the most recent version of the scripts. 
2. Copy the Masterfile_Groupings_2021.sav file from the Dropbox into the data folder in the RAPID-open project directory. 
3. Open and run the _RUNME.R script. This may take 5-10 minutes, so get a cup of coffee. 
4. If there are new open-ended questions, add them to the _site.yml file (in both the bigram and responses section).
5. Under the Build tab in RStudio, click Build Website. 
6. In GitHub Desktop, write something in the Summary box. Click "Commit to main", then 
7. "Push origin".

You're done!
